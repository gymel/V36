  alpha2.apr : Printed index production, 2nd run
  1996-02-14  collocation of equal lines (after sorting)

  alpha2 is INDEPENDENT of the configuration used;
         it should always be run with A.CFG ! (using only #u1 and #u2)

  Purpose : collocate all equal names with the page numbers or record numbers
            after the sort run with ASORT
            (#99z being used to transport the numbers)

  input :  #u2 contains a name, #99z a page number or record number

  output:  just one #u2 for every different name, all page numbers or record
           numbers chained up in #99z

pn="alphabetic index - step 2"

  --------- Constants  (don't change) ----------------------------
zl=0        no line breaking

zm=0        no page breaking (we produce a continuous file)

fl=0        no form arrangement

  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  no ak commands required. We have only one output per record,
  all input records are structured identically (#u1, #u2, #99z)
  For the comparison, we use #u1, for the printing, #u2

  ************* field list ****************************************

#u1 =nm+A e0
    compare #u1 with #unm. 
    if equal: go to #-A
    if not  : save it in #unm for the next comparison
              and do nothing, go to next line

  we had a different #u1, so we'll start a new export record:
#u2 p{ 0 13 10 1 "u2 " }  
        the p{ ... } explicitly ends the completed record and starts
                    the new one
        (we must do it this way because we must collocate several records
        with identical sort parts into one export record.)

#99z dsn f" " p{ 0 "99z" }     write #99z unchanged, it transports the number
        The 0 code marks the end of #u2!
        #99z is not closed with a 00h here, for there may be more records
             coming with the same #u1 content, these must be added 

#99z asn
        save #99z value in #usn, for maybe this repeats itself in the next
        record (a name may occur several times on the same page in the main
        part of the bibliography. We then have repeating values in #99z)
#+#     end for this record

#-A     we get here if the name is the same as in the last record

        Compare page number with #usn : if equal: do nothing
#99z =sn+# f" " p", "     if not equal: append it with ", "
        the f" " command removes leading spaces
#+#
