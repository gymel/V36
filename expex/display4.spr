 Subfields, prefixes, postfixes, and some special treatments.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 In some subfields, USMARC contains punctuation in addition to the subfield
 codes. Since the proper punctuation is supplied here by adding prefixes or
 postfixes, the redundant punctuation needs to be removed. We cannot simply
 omit the prefixes and postfixes in the parameter file, because some MARC
 records do not contain them in the data. Instead, we remove any punctuation
 with the F command, which removes final, single characters from the end of a
 data string.

 Note the structure of the F command:
 F";"
  remove a final ";"
 F";:"
  remove a final ";" AND ":"  (if both should occur, in any order)
 F";: "
  remove a final ";", ":" or space
  
#100 a F", "
 remove any final comma or space or both from the end of #100 subfield a
#100 d p" (" P")"
 if present, subfield d will be displayed enclosed in brackets
#240 C a F", " p"[" P"]"
#245 C a F" :/" 
#245 b F"/ " p" : "
#245 c p" / "
#260 a F":,; " p". - "
#260 b F", " p" : "
#260 c p", " P"."
#050 p"Shelfmark: " R

 As an experiment, inactivate the above line and activate the following one,
 and see what happens:
 #050 b"a" ,"_b_ _" p"Shelfmark: " R   

 Note:
 If the field or subfield in any export line is not found in the record, the
 program simply goes on to the next one.
