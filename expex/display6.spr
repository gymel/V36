 Positioning commands.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 So far, each line has begun at the left margin, and we have only influenced
 the shape of the display by experimenting with line length (zl=56) and
 introducing line feeds and carriage returns (C). We can also determine at
 what position in the line output should start, by how much a line should be
 indented, and at which line output should begin.

 With these commands, we can now determine the final shape of our output of
 MARC records. At the same time, we begin to arrange the fields into the
 required order, and supply appropriate punctuation.
 
zl=76
 each line is 76 characters long (after which it will break)
dx=1
 activate ANSI escape sequences

 Text elements:
4=C       
    start a new line (a useful "texel")
60=%12
    set the line length to 12 characters
65=%76 $ #13 &14
   %76 = set line length to 76 characters
       $ = go to home position (line 1)
         #13 = set indentation to position 13 (output therefore begins at 14)
             &14 = go to position 14 of current line
74=27 91 48 59 51 52 59 52 55 109    blue
76=27 91 48 59 51 48 59 52 55 109    normal
       (the figures  ^^^^^^^^  stand for a white background)

 First display the shelfmark in the top left:
#050 60 a
 ouput #050 subfield a (the LC classification), prefixing it with texel 60,
 which will set the line length to 12 characters 
#050 C b
 then output subfield b, on a new line

 At this point, we arrange for the body of the record to be displayed in
 another column level with the shelfmark. The series of positioning commands
 required to achieve this are strung together in texel 65:
#t65
 We could introduce them directly with the "t" command, in which case they
 would have to be enclosed in braces:
 #t{%76 $ #13 &14}
 Try altering the values in texel 65 to see how it affects the shape of the
 display.

#t74
 change to blue for author's name
#100 a F", " P":"
#t76
 change back to normal colour
#t4
 new line (i.e. texel 4; we could have put t{C}

#240 a p"["
 a of #240 contains the uniform title
#240 l p" <" P">"
 l contains the language, and will be enclosed in <...>
#240 p"]" e1 P4
 Note the "e" (end) command, here used for the first time. "e1" means "end
 after the 1st character of the export string". Since this is "]" (the prefix
 has seen to that), this line effectively means "output ']' if field #240 is
 present, but do not output the content of the field itself".
 Note also that we start a new line here by means of a postfix, not
 unconditional text entry as above. This is because field #240 is not always
 present, and if it is not present, we don't want another carriage return.
 Above, however, we want to start a new line irrespective of whether #100 is
 present, so that the title information always starts on the same line.
#245 a F" :/"
#245 h p" " F" :/"
#245 b " : " F"./ "
#245 c " / " F". "
#t{"."}
 Put a full stop after all the title information.
 Note how character strings in text elements must be enclosed in inverted
 commas, but not positioning commands.
