 Calculation commands - the final stage in the simple MARC export parameter.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Here, we develop the use of the subroutine, and use some calculation commands
 to number the added entries correctly.

 The use of a user-variable is also involved. We need it to start off the
 numbering from 1, and obtain it with the very first export line below, which
 introduces a number of new concepts.

zl=76
dx=1

4=C       
60=%12
65=%76 $ #13 &14
74=27 91 48 59 51 52 59 52 55 109
76=27 91 48 59 51 48 59 52 55 109

 To produce the user-variable "rn" with the content "1":
 (This will be done for every new record being exported)
#dt p"1" e1 =rn
 Take the user-variable "dt" (= date), preface it with "1", end after the
 first character (i.e. the prefaced "1"), then load the content of the
 workstring (simply the "1") into user-variable "rn".
 What is all this about?
 We use field #dt as nothing more than a device to get an export line going,
 for which we need some field which is invariably going to be present. Since
 #dt is one of the special fields that allegro always generates when it starts
 up, we can always be sure that it is there. What we really want is the "1":
 to get it, we preface the date with "1", then immediately end the workstring
 after the "1", by ending it after the first character (the "e1" command).
 Finally, we store the workstring in user-variable "rn" (the "=rn" command). 

 Now go to the end of this file to discover the use to which we put this
 user-variable in subroutine "r".

#(A
 At this point in DISPLAY8 we arranged for "I. " to be placed before each
 added entry.  We will now number them correctly by using another subroutine
 which we will call "r":
#>r
#cc b"a" e"d" ,"_e_ [_" ,"_?_ -- _"
#cc d p" (" P")"
#cc b"d" b"?" p" -- " ,"_e_ [_" ,"_?_ -- _"
#)A

 Subroutine "r", to generate roman numbers for the added author entries.
#(r
#urn x">1" p". " e2
 The "x" introduces either a calculation or a comparison, and what follows it
 consists of two parts: command+value. Here, the command is saying "if the
 content of #urn is greater than (>) 1, prefix it with ". ", and end after the
 second character, i.e. output ". ". This is done to put a full-stop after the
 previous added entry, before the next one is exported. If #urn is not greater
 than 1, there will be no previous entry, so no full-stop is needed. 
 Note that when one of these comparisons does not detect a match, there is no
 output. This is a particularly important consideration in the following list.
#urn x"==1" p"I. " e3
 Here, we need to start assigning the roman numerals. The "==" tells the
 programme to compare #urn with 1. If it is the same, it will be prefixed with
 "I. ", and the output will end after the third character, leaving just the
 roman numeral. If #urn is not the same, nothing will happen, and we proceed to
 the next line.
#urn x"==2" p"II. " e4     the prefix is 4 characters long
#urn x"==3" p"III. " e5     and 5 in this case. The e command has the effect 
#urn x"==4" p"IV. " e4      that just the prefix will be exported
#urn x"==5" p"V. " e3
#urn x"==6" p"VI. " e4
#urn x"==7" p"VII. " e5
#urn x"==8" p"VIII. " e6
#urn x"==9" p"IX. " e4
#urn x"==10" p"X. " e3
#urn x"==11" p"XI. " e4
#urn x"==12" p"XII. " e5
#urn x"==13" p"XIII. " e6
#urn x"==14" p"XIV. " e5
#urn x"==15" p"XV. " e4
#urn x"==16" p"XVI. " e5
#urn x"==17" p"XVII. " e6
#urn x"==18" p"XVIII. " e7
#urn x"==19" p"XIX. " e5
#urn x"==20" p"XX. " e4
#urn x"+1" =rn
 Now the next #700 field (#700a, #700b, &c.) will be sent down to be processed,
 and the roman numberal must be incremented by 1. The x"+1" =rn does this, so
 that if #urn was "2", it will now be "3", and the above list will therefore
 see that the output is "III. ".
