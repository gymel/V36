 Substitutions in export lines.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 It is possible to perform straight substitutions in an export line. MARC
 records invite this treatment, as the arrangement of subfields within each
 field usually follows ISBD order, which is a commonly used display format.

 We will use this device to display the imprint field #260. We could also have
 exported most of the main title field #245 in this way - the flexibility of
 the allegro export language often allows the same result to be achieved in a
 number of different ways. 

 The portions of the parameter file explained so far will be passed over
 without comment:
 
zl=76
dx=1

4=C       
60=%12
65=%76 $ #13 &14
74=27 91 48 59 51 52 59 52 55 109
76=27 91 48 59 51 48 59 52 55 109

#050 60 a
#050 C b
#t65
#t74
#100 a F", " P":"
#t76
#t4
#240 a p"["
#240 l p" "
#240 p"]" e1 P4
#245 a F" :/"
#245 h p" " F" :/"
#245 b " : " F"./ "
#245 c " / " F". "
#t{"."}

 The imprint line follows, making extensive use of the "local substitution"
 command. First learn its syntax:
 1. It begins with a comma: ,
 2. The substitution is enclosed in quotation marks: ,"........"
 3. The substition takes the form _old string_new string_
 Putting all this together, we get:
 ,"_old string_new string_"
 
 Now we apply it to field #260:
#260 C b"a" ,"_a_ ; _" ,"_; ;_;_" ,"_b_ : _" ,"_ : :_ :_" ,"_c_, _" ,"_,, _, _" p"    " F". " P"."

 Note:
 1. The imprint begins on a new line (C).
 2. If the punctuation was already included in the data (as it is in true US
    MARC records), the substitution will have produced double punctuation; in
    this case, the following substitution will remove it - a clumsy, but
    necessary expedient.
 3. The prefix p"    " has the effect of indenting the imprint line, making the
    shape of the record a little clearer.
 4. All the export commands for a given field must be strung in a continuous
    line with no breaks, even if this is long.

 Try to arrange the output of #245 by using local substitutions.
 Conversely, try to arrange the output of #260 by picking out the subfields
 one by one.
