 Subroutines.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

 When an indefinite number of different fields are all to be processed in the
 same way, this is done with a subroutine.  The export line reads the field,
 then refers the content to a subsidiary program, which is usually placed just
 below the main body of the parameter.

 We need to use a subroutine to process the added entries which are usually
 listed below the unit entry of a record which is exported in card format, as
 in this parameter. These consist of added authors in the #700 fields, plus the
 word "Title" at the end of the list. Needless to say, it is entirely
 unpredictable how many of these will appear in a given record, or even if any
 will appear at all. Furthermore, they must be numbered sequentially in roman
 numerals.

 In this parameter we will deal with the basic structure of subroutines,
 showing how this is applied to the #700 fields, and then address the more
 complicated matter of the numbering in the final experimental parameter.

 Go to the end of what we have studied so far.

 Added entries, which start on a new line:
#t4
 The next line presents a two new commands: the "++" which immediately follows
 the field tag and the ">" command:
#700 ++ >A m>A
 First, the "++" tells the program to process not only #700 itself, but also
 any repetitions of that field that might be present (#700a, #700b, &c.).
 Then, ">A" tells the programme to put the content of the field through
 subroutine A below. But we also want the repetitions of the field to be put
 through the subroutine: the "m>A" does that. Subroutines can be labelled
 with any alpha-numeric character.
#+Z
 Then, jump to #-Z below. The jumpmark consists of "+" followed by any
 alpha-numeric character or special character, and its destination is "-"
 followed by the same character.

 Subroutine.
 Note:
 1. This one is labelled "A", and is therefore reached by the command ">A" in
    the export line.
 2. The subroutine is placed below the main body of the parameter file, and
    starts with #(A and ends with #)A.
 3. After it has been executed, the programme continues with the other export
    lines, if there are any. 
 4. Within the subroutine, whatever has been specified by export line (#700,
    #700a, #700b, &c.) is held in the variable #cc.

#(A    added entries persons
#t{"I. "}
#cc b"a" e"d" ,"_e_ [_" ,"_?_ -- _"
#cc d p" (" P")"
#cc b"d" b"?" p" -- " ,"_e_ [_" ,"_?_ -- _"
#t{". "}
#)A
 the commands in these export lines are already familiar, except for the
 wildcard in the string ,"_?_ -- _" which simply tells the programme to replace 
 any other subfield with the combination " -- " .

#-Z
 the destination of the jumpmark #+Z
