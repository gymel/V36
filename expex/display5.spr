 Text elements.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 When the same prefix and postfix occurs repeatedly in the same parameter file,
 it is convenient to use a so-called "text elements" ("texels") as a shorthand
 way of representing it. Text elements can also be used to effect changes of
 both colour and positioning. They can be introduced into the display with
 either the usual prefix and postfix commands in association with the export of
 a particular field, or the "t" command which introduces them unconditionally.

 In this parameter, we will use them to replace some of the prefixes, and also
 to produce a colour change.  In other respects, the parameter is identical
 with DISPLAY4.SPR.

 Texels are usually placed at the beginning of the parameter file, just before
 the export lines. There can be up to 99 of them, numbered as you like.

1=" : "
 1 stands for " : " in the export lines 
71=27 91 48 59 51 49 59 52 55 109    red
   Esc [  0  ;  3  1  ;  4  7  m
   an ANSI escape sequence, which will produce the colour red on white

72=27 91 49 59 51 50 59 52 55 109    green
73=27 91 48 59 51 51 59 52 55 109    yellow
74=27 91 48 59 51 52 59 52 55 109    blue
75=27 91 48 59 51 53 59 52 55 109    magenta
76=27 91 48 59 51 48 59 52 55 109    normal
77=27 91 49 59 51 54 59 52 55 109    cyan
78=27 91 48 59 51 55 59 52 55 109    white

 The following command is required to activate the ANSI escape sequences;
 its placing within the file has no significance:
dx=1

#t71   display texel 71 (which will change the colour to red)

#100 a F", "
#100 d p" (" P")"
#t76   change the colour back to normal

#240 C a F", " p"[" P"]"
#245 C a F" :/" 
#245 b F"/ " p1
 preface the content with texel 1 (" : ")
#245 c p" / "
#260 a F":,; " p". - "
#260 b F", " p1
#260 c p", " P"."
#050 p"Shelfmark: " R

 Try replacing the other prefixes and postfixes with texels.
