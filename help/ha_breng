In the Browse Window you see the brief list of the current result set.

Move this window to the lower right, then you will always see the current record
in the "Select" list while you move the highlight bar in the browse window.
This immediate display function can be switched off - in a slow network
the bar movement may otherwise be a bit sluggish.

Into the "Show" field, enter a #number to jump to the resp. record.
For offline data, you can also enter something like \20; the display of every
record will then begin with the field #20.

o [Nr./Find]  In this field, you enter either a number, like #123,
      or a character string for searching.
     -- a number brings up the corresponding line
     -- a search term searches in the list, using
        [+] / [-]  for forward and backward

[Asc/Desc] reverses the sort direction.
Buttons [<<] and [>>] shift the sort point left / right.
After pressing one of these once, hold '>' or '<' down for rapid shifting.
[List] copies the browse list to the display window for cut-and-pasting.
The maximum sort threshold can be set by entering a number with prefix 's':
"s10000"  means: do the automatic sort if the set is smaller than 10000.
The [SORT] button will always sort the result set as long as there is 
sufficient memory (up to 16000 records).
  
Tips: Key # brings up the full line if the window is not wide enough.
