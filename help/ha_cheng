In this dialog window you can do the following:

Upper part : ONLINE SEARCH
1. Enter search commands for the various indexes. Truncation can be activated
   as well as Expansion (to include linked subrecords in the results - if the
   database supports this feature).
   If qualifiers are defined for the database, these are offered for use.
   Special buttons:
   [Repeat] : Restore the values of your last search
   [Clear]    : Reset all fields


Lower part : FULL-TEXT SEARCH
2. Enter a full text search command for offline redords. This will start a
   full text search in the current result set, even if it is an online set. 
   This function requires exact spelling.
   Full-text search through the whole database is not possible with this, you
   have to select or form a result set first.

Tip: Subsequently, the combined search command will be visible in the 
"Find" command line of the main window. You may change it there and submit
it again for another search.
