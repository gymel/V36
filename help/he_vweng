You are now looking at your current ViewList

Move this window to the lower right, then you will always see the current record
in the "Select" list while you move the highlight bar.
This immediate display function can be switched off - in a slow network
the bar movement may otherwise be a bit sluggish.
(If the highlighted line does not stand for a record (like a comment line or
a summation line), the last record remains in the display.)

What does the [In-/Activate] button do?

The current line is marked by an 'X' / or this mark is removed.
This means: when exporting this ViewList, or when using the [List] button,
such lines are skipped.

Into the "Show" field, enter a number to jump to the resp. line.

[List] copies the ViewList to the display window for cut-and-pasting.
Hint:
A99 permits writing in the display window (useful, e.g., before printing)

Window size : F11 or use the mouse.
