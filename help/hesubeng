This auxiliary window appears if the field selected for entry or editing has
subfield definitions (in the CFG of your database).
Select the subfields you want to enter, and then enter just the text. 
When this window is closed, the subfields will be concatenated and the combined 
text will appear in the Write field for further modification.
If you don't want to use this auxiliary window, just press [Ready] or Alt+r
and do all editing in the Write field.
