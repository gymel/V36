Data entry forms assist the editing and inputting of records.
The form definitions are in a file of type .FRM which can be modified and 
extended at any time.
ONLY if the [Enter] key is pressed while the cursor is in a form field, the 
program copies the content of the field into the corresponding field of the 
current record. The display and select fields will show this immediately.
Right after [Enter], the program checks the field content for formal correctness.
Move the form to the lower right to watch the effect.
If Enter is not used, fields will be copied only upon leaving the form.
At any time you can select another form to enter any fields contained in it.
Fields will always be inserted into the current record.
[Index]  Open relevant index, maybe copy an entry from there.
[Get]    "Refreshes" the form, inserting all current contents of fields
[Copy]   copies current field from current record (after mistyping or such)
[Reserve]    copies current field from reserve store
[+]   These buttons serve to switch forward and back between multiple fields.
[-]   Their effect is always on the field that has the focus.
   For [+] there's an additional function: if no further multiple field exists,
   a new one is created (the current line then turns blank to receive new input).
[Index]  jumps into the index (position related to current field)
   While working in a form, you can activate the index, select a line and press
   the index window's [Copy] button to transfer the index line into the form.
[End] or [Esc] closes the form editor.
