In this dialog window you can

Upper part : ONLINE SEARCH
1. Enter search commands for the logical indexes. Truncation can be activated
   as well as Expansion (to include linked subrecords in the results).
   In the entry field you can add more search terms to the effect that you
   can construct complete "avanti" search statements. For example:
   shake? and erj >=1989
   If at this moment the personal name index is active, this is turned into.
   find per shake? and erj >=1989
   If qualifiers are defined for the database, these are offered for use.
   Special buttons:
   [Repeat] : Restore the values of your last search
   [Clear]    : Reset all fields
PLEASE: fill fields brom top to bottom! Not, e.g., only the 2nd or 2rd field
   or only the 1st and 3rd fields - this won't work.

   If no search terms are entered but only a restriction, then this will
   be applied to the current result set.


Lower part : FULL-TEXT SEARCH
2. Enter a full text search command for offline redords. This will start a
   full text search in the current result set, even if it is an online set. 
   Exact spelling (upper-/lowercase) is not necessary.
