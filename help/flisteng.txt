             Checklist of "a99" and "alcarta" files
             ======================================

This list describes all files necessary to run "a99" and/or "alcarta",
where to locate them, and what purposes they serve.
(More Help: INSTENG.RTF for necessary adaptations)

You CAN start "a99" or "alcarta" and see how far you get. But if you
need to economize on your time, you better consult this list.
(We'd like to make everything as simple as possible. Databases, however,
happen to be a complex world. Some knowledge and some configuring will
therefore always be necessary.)

"a99" works if all files are on the directory from where it is started.
In networks, one usually has a single ProgDir whose name has to
be set in the INI file of a database. 
Or : start a99.exe with its complete path name.

Most files will first be looked for in the data directory (DbDir); 
that's because there may be database specific versions of them.

We use these names for the possible locations of files:

PATH    : directories registered in the DOS PATH variable

DbDir   : Name of the database directory
          For the demobase:  C:\ALLEGRO\DEMO2

Local   : User's work directory. Files sitting here are user-specific.
          (Local is always a possible location, but not always the default)
          Single-user: normally Local=C:\ALLEGRO
          Multi-user: Local = TEMP directory of Windows

ProgDir : Default = C:\ALLEGRO
          Files not found on either DbDir or Local will be searched here.
          (see list below)

MULTI-USER ENVIRONMENT
Every user has to have a home directory, Local, and start from there!
No specific files have to be on Local but it will be used for temporary
files. This means the user has to have write permission on Local.

Which files have to be adapted or may be changed?

An [X] marks those files that have to be adapted or created for every database.
        (Only these HAVE TO be changed, all others can remain unchanged,
        at least until changes become desirable)

   [v] means this file may be changed but can remain as it is
   [o] means "optional" - these files are dispensable


Name               Location (in the order of searching)
                   and meaning
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   The order of searching is not the same for all files!
                   This has reasons.

1. General    (independent of CFG and Database, no changes needed)
----------
              ENG works if there is the command  Language=ENG  in *.INI


A99.EXE            PATH
ALCARTA.EXE        The programs
FLEX.EXE           Starts FLEXes from outside the program. This way,
                   a99 can work as a server program

A9.BAT        [v]  PATH
ALC.BAT            Batches for easy launching
                   Tu use these, attach your DbDir XYZ to Local
                   and have XYZ.INI on XYZ
                   Then start with  a9 xyz  (for a99) or
                                   alc xyz  (for alcarta)
                   Else: make your own batch file after the same pattern!
                   Or: start with  a99 0  and then select your INI file

CGI.EXE            Auxiliary program for RuckZuck.
                   Belongs on the CGI directory of the Webserver

A99.INI            Commented list of all INI Commands
                   (Use as a template for new  INI files)

UIF0ENG            Local / ProgDir. (not dbDir!) Default = GER (not ENG)
UIF0GER            User Interface Files. (Button and menu captions et al.)
UIFEENG       [v]  (Hotkeys may be changed here!)
UIFEGER       [v]

         For users of the conventional "allegro" programs:
RS.BAT        [v]  PATH  (Batch and parameters for PRESTO call)
AS.BAT             RS for "a99" , AS for "alcarta" (APAC call)
RS.cPR        [v]  Local / ProgDir
                   If PRESTO/APAC are started from a99/alcarta, they
                   produce RS.SET as their export file. a99 reads it

D-W0.APR           DbDir / Local / ProgDir   Default, if D-W.APR missing
E-W0.APR           Local / ProgDir   Default, if E-W.APR missing
                                     wenn E-W.APR fehlt
DOOR.BAT      [v]  PATH
                   External program, called when the door button is pressed.
                   If DOOR.FLX exists, it will supersede DOOR.BAT.
                   You can install any program call here.
                   If the external prog produces a file EXTERN.DAT in the
                   "allegro" external format, this can be loaded as "external
                   result set" after returning to "a99". ("File" menu)
                   See comment in DOOR.BAT!

NSC.BAT       [v]  To launch Netscape. Modify if Netscape is in a different
                   directory or if you want to use other browsers
                   (called from appropriate flips, see CoOL database: flips are
                   defined in the display parameters  D-WRTF.APR)
                   Alternative: if a flip contains a command like
                     start <url>
                   then NSC.BAT is not needed.


PHRASE.A99    [v]  Local
                   Contains codes for special character input. Some can be
                   activated by Ctrl+x , others with \ und subsequent letter.
                   Instead of \ a different character can be used as
                   defined in your INI file  (e.g., ESC=43 for + )
                   If \ (or +) itself is to be entered: \\ (bzw. ++)
                   (No comments or empty lines in PHRASE.A99 ! )
                   Per phrase  2  lines:
                       Character or ASCII Number
                       Phrase text or ASCII code of replacement
                   Preferably edited from DOS and using OSTWEST.FON
                   (and in full screen mode, to see the special characters.)
              [v]  In .INI, a different name of phrase file can be set
                   using the  Phrase=  key.

PHRASEN	      Contains a basic set of phrases, mostly special characters.
              Will be loaded when there is no PHRASE.A99.


2. Database specific  DbName = Database name (4 characters or less)
--------------------

xyz.INI       [X]  Name and location arbitrary; call "a99" this way:
                   A99 <full path name of INI file>

                   for example:
                   A99 c:\bolero\bol.ini    or
                   A99 cat.ini        (if cat.ini is Local)
                   A99 cat            (omission of .ini is OK)
                   Use a copy of A99.INI to make a new .INI

HE_??ENG      [v]  General Help files   (List ==> HELP.TXT)
...                Local / DbDir / ProgDir\HELP / ProgDir (!)
HE???ENG           (database specific versions possible)
DbNameENG.RTF [o]  Database specific general help. Location: DbDir
  alcarta:         DbName = Name of database. Template: CATENG.RTF or
  HA  for  HE      one of the other databases.
                   Is brought up by the big Question mark button
                   This file can contain useful Flips as well, see EJOENG.RTF.
                   Default (if missing): HEGENENG / HAGENENG

   Help files are searched first with, then without language tag (ENG or GER)

HE_InENG      [o]  DbDir
 (for alcarta:)    n=1...9,:  Index related help files; brought up by
HA_InENG           Button [?] of index window
                   Default (if missing): HE_IXENG

*.RTF         [o]  Local / DbDir / ProgDir     (==> HELP.TXT, FLIP.TXT)
                   Specific, user-developed help files
                   (Called via Flips)  Write as RTF using WinWord

<DATABASE>         Location always  DbDir  (per definition)
                   DbName_*.ALD, .ADX, .TBL, .STL, .RES
DbName.cPI    [X]  DbDir.  Contains the symbolic index names! (see EJO.API)
                   O.APT has to be included, see also D-WRTF.cPR

$c.CFG             DbDir / ProgDir, (Local is also possible)
  or c.CFG         Configuration file [same as for the DOS programs]

DbName.FRM    [o]  DbDir / ProgDir / Local
                   Data input forms. See FORM.TXT and INPUT.TXT

*.FLX         [o]  DbDir / ProgDir\FLEX / ProgDir / Local
                   FLEX Files (see FLEXENG.RTF)
                   Started from a flip or from outside (EXFLEX.TXT, FLEX.EXE)

*.VW          [o]  DbDir / ProgDir\VIEW / ProgDir / Local
                   ViewLists (see "news" 58, Oct.2000)
                   Display a FLEX list using command  View name

DbName.SGF         DbDir
                   Signal file. If beginning with '1', a99/alcarta will
                   not start. Following the '1' there may be a message
                   for the users telling them why they get no access.

D-WRTF.cPR    [X]  DbDir / ProgDir (derived from D-1.cPR (DOS display))
                   Record display parameters
                   (To load other suitable parameters: menu View|Display par)
                   Include:  O.cPT, D.cPT, D-RTF.cPT (There have to be these
                 to
                 td
                 td-rtf
                   lines in it. O.APT will always be loaded by default!
                   (If that's not wanted (Chinese!) make O.APT empty)
                   Further differences from DOS:
                   There has to be a section  #-(  for the "internal display"
                   See D-WRTF.APR for it: copy the section from there.
                   If Flips are wanted, they have to be programmed in this
                   file (see "news" 52 and examples in D-WRTF.APR)
                   D-W0.APR  is default for D-WRTF.APR
                   but it provides a very plain display only.

E-W.cPR       [o]  DbDir / ProgDir. For export and external editing
E-W0.APR           (command  ExportParameter in .INI)
                      if missing, default = E-W0.APR

P-W.cPR       [X]  DbDir / Local / ProgDir.
P-W0.cPR           Print format. (Command  PrintParameter in .INI)
                   (e.g., modification of D-WRTF.APR, no Flips etc.)
                   P-W0.cPR is default, if P-W.cPR is missing,
                   it can be a copy of P-W0.APR

D-RTF.cPT     [v]  DbDir / Local / ProgDir
                   RTF commands (Boldface etc., colors. Copy of D-RTF.APT)
                   (to be included in display parameters and RTF-Exports!)

DISPHEAD.RTF  [v]  DbDir / ProgDir / Local
LISTHEAD.RTF       Header files for RTF displays. Used automatically.
HELPHEAD.RTF       Database specific versions possible (Fonts!)
LONGHEAD.RTF       Not editable by WinWord because no complete RTF files
                   Changes normally not necessary, but generally for
                   special effects or fonts in display or export.


3. Defaults (Normally need no alterations)
-----------

O.APT         [v]  DbDir / Local / ProgDir
D.APT         [v]  Tables for character codes  ASCII -:- ANSI
                   Included automatically if commands  to  and  td  missing
                   O.APT  for Index AND Display parameters
                          contains only o commands, works both ways
                          (i.e., has to be a 1:1 mapping)
                          Needed for displays with correct column arrangement
                          (Index, Brief browsing display)
                          Also for data display in the listbox (left side)
                          and for external editing.
                   (If o.cPT is missing, o.APT will be used!)

                   D.APT  ASCII->ANSI  only for display and export params,
                          contains only p and q commands for display window
                          (Umlauts, accented letters, special characters)
                          This need not be an 1:1 mapping.

E.ADT         [o]  Local
                   Contains a skeletal record to be loaded into the current
                   record (menu "Edit | Get"); default fields or such
                   (for data input assistance)

EBOX.ICO      [o]  Location anywhere. Use as desktop icon

A-TIMES.TTF        These fonts have to be installed!
A-LETTER.TTF       (Location mostly in C:\WINDOWS\FONTS)
                   A-LETTER is for columnar displays (even spacing)

A-ARIAL.TTF        Optional (Alternative to A-TIMES)


Just FYI:
4. Dynamic Files (exist at runtime only, do not manipulate)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

OUTPUT.ADT         Default Export file (INI: OutputFile=...)

EXX.XXX            For external editing of current record
                   (INI: ExEdFile=... )

RS.SET             For DOS users only

The following are mostly temporary (persistent only if you choose to continue
a session later). They are created on the user's Local directory, mostly
on the Windows TEMP path:

DbName._1          Bookmarks
DbName._2          History list
DbName._i          Result sets (Lists of internal rec numbers)
DbName.$$$         Copies of records during editing sessions
DbName.TAB         Auxiliary table (Adresses of records in .$$$)
DbName.RSS         Auxiliary file (result set names)
DbName.RXX         Auxiliary (a99 only)

All of these files may be erased if you do not want to continue the session
during which they were created.
