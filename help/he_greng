Up to three replacements can be executed at the same time.
Into the "in Field" area, enter a field tag to restrict the replacement to that
particular field.
If, for example, you want the replacement done in all fields of Group #4, enter
"#4" into the "in Field" area.
If you enter "#40" , the replacement will take effect also in #402 or #40a!
If you want it done only in #40: enter one blank after the "#40".

Special cases:

   (nothing)          #nnnText       Insert   #nnnText  into the records
   #nnn                 #kkk               Change  #nnn  into  #kkk
   #nnn                 (nothing)        Delete  #nnn

Under "Find:" as well as under "Replace:" subfield codess (<Alt>+<2>: triangle) 
may be used, but not under "(in Field)".

ATTENTION: the first special case, the insertion of a new field into the record,
can NOT be effected by entering the text in the middle and the field tag under
"in Field"! Both must be entered in the middle field.
