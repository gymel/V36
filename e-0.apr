  E-0.APR : EXTERN Prototype : to download records in ASCII format
  960214           with tags, line breaking, or even page breaking

  Output : records in allegro basic format:
           written as ASCII text file, fields with tags
           every field on a new line, line breaking at 66 characters
           longer fields indented on continuation lines

  Purpose: Output file can be used
           a) as an interface to other software that would be able to read it
           b) as a proof reading list for data entry operators

  Batch  : EXTERN.BAT

pn="E-0 : Prototype for EXTERNAL format"


  --------- Constants (to be changed as needed) -------------------

zl=66	    Line length
zi=4	    Indentation 4 spaces on continuation lines of long fields
   ^         Activate one of the following if needed:
 zi=5         5 for 3-byte tag configurations
 zi=6         6 for 4-byte tag configurations
zm=0        no page breaking (continuous output as a file)
 zm=62       page breaking at 62 lines  (activate if wanted)
    ~~
ae=13 10    another line feed at end-of-record
   ~~~~~
fl=0        List format (no card-like format with fixed number of
                         lines per record)
ks=0	    Start position 0 in every field (i.e., the tags will be written
   ~                                         with the '#' in front!)
 ks=1        Write tags without the '#'  (activate this line if wanted)
ke=C &0     Field end: new line + start on position 0 for new field

 tprinter    activate if you want a print file
             (printer.apt will be loaded, it's a copy of a p-*.apt)

dx=1        not necessary, just for testing to see all codes on screen

  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  ********* Field list ********************************************

  EITHER we want full output of all fields: then we just use
  the global export command:
  ~~~~~~~~~ Application specific part ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ##      global output of all fields in their internal order

       we can exclude some fields by the '/' command:
 /25   if #25 is to be excluded from the global output
 /9..  if all fields of group #9 are to be excluded
 /33.  if all fields #33x are to be excluded

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

  OR we want a specific selection of fields only, then we list them:
  ----- deactivate this section if you activate the above one ------
#01         Hierarchy (volume numbers) in subrecords
#02
#03
#04
#05

#20              Title
#40. ++          all authors (#40, #40a, #40b, ...)
#74              place
#75              publisher
#76              year
#77              collation
#90              call number
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  ****************************************************************************

 Code changes : add p-commands if some characters must be coded
                differently in the output
 Examples:
 p „ "ae"   to write se instead of „
 p { [      replace { by [ in the output
 p @ 1      omit (suppress) @ in the output
 p # 95     replace '#' by ASCII code 95 (decimal)
 p à .27 2 1 224 27 2 0
            replace à by a (decimal) escape sequence
 p à "alpha"   replace character by word

 If any fields need to be coded differently, use additional q commands:
 (and write  !nnn  instead of  #nnn for those fields)

 q a/z 65   turn smalls into caps  (for example)
 q „ "ae"   and so on
