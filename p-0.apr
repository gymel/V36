  P-0.APR : PRINT Prototype : to prepare a PRINTABLE file with page head and foot
  960214

  Output : ASCII text, possibly with control characters for printing
           This file is responsible for the arrangements of field texts
           and for the line width, punctuation, page breaking and such.
           The printer controls are taken from an P-*.APT file
           which is selected from CockPit by menu "Options / Print format"

  Purpose: To turn database files or basic files into printable files
           In most cases, the first step is an export in sortable form,
           then comes the sorting with ASORT, then this as the last step.
           This means there will be a #u2 containing the print header
           for each record. This is used below.

  What follows is largely application specific.

  ~~~~~~~~~ Constants ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

zl=72       Line length of printout
zi=5        Indention: 5 characters from 2nd line of record
fl=0        Form length 0, that means no form printing, rather page formatting
ae=13 10    record end: add a line feed
zm=62       max number of lines per page. OR:
  zm=0       continuous output without page breaks, better suited as input
             for word processors
z1=0        don't break records at page boundaries

i4=0        enable V14 links

tprinter    load printer driver  (PRINTER.APT)
            this is one of the P-*.APT files, selected from CockPit
               by menu  "Options / printer"

  ......... Text elements ..........................................
4=C         new line (Carriage return+line feed)
13=C C      2 new lines
20="--  "
            PRINTER.APT  contains numbers 79 to 99
            examples:  99 = bold on
                       98 = bold off
                       88 = italics on

    But for main records, #hi does not exists. Then we continue here:
