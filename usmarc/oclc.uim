      OCLC Tape Format --> MARC allegro

      This is a partially self-explanatory parameter file
      for the import function. it controls the processing
      of MARC records


al=5         rec length is coded in first two bytes      
am=1          in decimal digits

y .30 0      replace 1E = MARC field terminator by zero (allegro field end)
             it's also the last byte of directory!

 fs=4         field start = 4 bytes after position given in directory
              (all fields start with 2 indicators + a)
fc=1         field length correction: subtract fc from directory length

fr=1         field repetition increment
fm=a         #650a follows #650




    conversion of coded special characters, e.g. èa -->> „

    now we come to the field description paragraphs:
    each begins with an allegro tag number, followed by a srch command
    (e.g. D"008"  means: search for MARC tag 008
    pre-processing commands may follow


 command:     comment:
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
           (lines beginning with spaces are treated as comments;
           2 spaces separate comment from command)
