  C-0.APR : COUNT Prototype : to evaluate frequencies of field contents
  960214          result file must be sorted, then exported with COUNT2.APR

  Output : sortable records containing just the fields to be counted
           These must then be sorted and, as a last step, exported
           by SRCH with COUNT2.APR to produce the listing

  Purpose: If you have subject entries or classification codes in certain
           fields, for example, you might wish to find out which particular
           entries have been used in these fields and how often.

  Batch  : COUNT.BAT

pn="C-0 : Prototype for COUNT"

  No Configuration specific parts!
  Application specifics are marked with ~~~
  ~~~~~~~~~~~
  This parameter set produces records in this format:

  #u1 sort code (in small letters and without special characters)
  #u2 Original form of the field represented by #u1
      this will be used in the last stage to prepare the listing

  2nd stage : ASORT sorts the resulting file
  3rd stage : SRCH exports the sorted file using COUNT2.APR

  COUNT2.APR is independent of the underlying format, i.e. you can use it
  with any .CFG.

  --------- Constants ---------------------------------------------

zl=0        no line breaking

  --------- this is all! ------------------------------------------

   The heading command is very probably the only thing you need
   to change if you want to evaluate other fields:

   ======== heading command ======================================

ak=31."[;]"+A    process all #31x fields, separate at '' and ';'
   ~~~~~~~~~
   another example:
   ak=74+A        evaluate places of publication
   ak=90+A        call number (may need some other kind of manipulation,
                      see below)

   ===============================================================

   ******** field list *******************************************

#+-         if there was no heading, do nothing

#-A
!u1 f" " F" " p{ 1 "u1 " }     #u1 contains the string to be evaluated.
    ~~~~~~~~~                   it is prefixed by <01h> and "u1 " to make it
                                exportable (after the sort) by SRCH
   if only part of the field is to be evaluated, add appropriate
   manipulation commands. For example:
   !u1 e"-" p{ 1 "u1 " }     cut #u1 at '-' , use only the part preceding '-'
                             may be useful to evaluate call number groups

#t{ 0 }                      field end : Code 00h

#u1 f" " F" " p"u2 "         same field in printable form as #u2
    ~~~~~~~~~
#t{ 0 C }                record end : codes 0 13 10

   ****************************************************************

   we load the code table:

ts     load S.APT for the sort coding
       (contains q commands which then act on !u1
        remember:  #xx is coded by p commands
                   !xx is coded by q commands
